# Hi there!!!

It should run with docker run, but... I found out I have some local problems 
with docker, so I couldn't make working docker container, cause
solving docker took too much time, I decided to leave it. 
Sorry for that

#### If you have python 3.7 installed

from file:
    
    cat input-example.txt | python main.py 
    
Or just:

    python main.py
    
Last option require hand input which could be boring.

Note!
It works only with python >=  3.7, 
cause I wanted to use `dataclasses` at least once in my life.
